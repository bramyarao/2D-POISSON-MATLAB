## Solving the 2D Poissons problem
<div style="text-align: justify"> 
 This work applies the Reproducing Kernel Collocation (RKCM) method to solve the 2D Poissons problem. This is a meshfree numerical method using points as discretization in the domain. The Reproducing Kernel shape function is used in the model. For details regarding the complete formulaltion refer to [this](https://doi.org/10.1002/num.20539) paper.
