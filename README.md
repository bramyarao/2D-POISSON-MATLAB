## Solving the 2D Poissons problem

<div style="text-align: justify"> 

 This work applies the Reproducing Kernel Collocation (RKCM) method to solve the 2D Poissons problem. This is a meshfree numerical method using points as discretization in the domain. The Reproducing Kernel shape function is used as the approximation function in the model. For details regarding the complete formulaltion refer to <a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/num.20539">this</a> paper. 
 
The details of the problem statement and results are given in the following slides.
